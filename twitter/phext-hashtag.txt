No, #phext is a bedrock technology for information.

Normal text is 2D - columns and lines.
Phext amps that up to 11D - by adding a coordinate system of coordinate systems.

Z: Libraries, Shelves, Series
Y: Collections, Volumes, Books
X: Chapters, Sections, Scrolls

#phext is a way to expand text to encompass all information on the Internet into one logical file.

You can think of it as a coordinate system of coordinate systems.

To navigate phext, you need 9 more dimension breaks. See https://phext.io/examples.html for a sampling of ideas.

it's all good - one of the use cases for #phext will be training networks of LLMs, to produce even better pepe memes ;)

(you can also think of phext as a file system within a file)

Semantic Zoom would pair well with http://phext.io!

I'm currently focused on adding support in core tools (C#, C++, Rust, js, etc.) - but at some point I'll start hacking on the UX.

(#Phext is a new way to interact with vast amounts of text using an implicit hierarchy.)
