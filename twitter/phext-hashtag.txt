#Phext: a way to encode an arbitrary DAG of documents as plain text with no overhead.

I haven't built an easy conversion tool yet, hence my question.

I'll support zip, tar, git, and other formats, but if you have a preference I'll write it first.

What's driving your data model? I'm going to focus on UX for #phext in February.

Latency is one of my most important metrics in general. We've got SSDs that can write 1 GB/sec and our systems are still slow. It's bonkers!

I'm looking to build a core user group for #phext development in February - 18 users to guide early development.

If more than 18 people are interested, I'll choose at random. I think there are ~10 of you so far.

- Weekly Updates
- Your ideas prioritized

Please RT for reach.

yeah, but it's worth exploring - with #phext (an 11D expansion of text that I invented), it becomes very simple to write text-only databases.

the main ingredient that I'm looking for next: a family of content hashing algorithms.

trying to solve this problem helps that goal.

Right, this is more foundational. I'm building #phext for the technology, not a business. I'm not looking to monetize it at all.

I don't have any datasets, just a file format. If anything, I would look for ways to help discern credit from what other systems generate.

I wrote a #phext visualization that shows who's discussing it each day. Once I get the process ironed out, I'll setup a nightly sync. For now, I'm updating the data by hand.

- https://github.com/wbic16/phextio/blob/master/signal.php renders the calendar

v4.2.5 adds a (non real-time) rendering of the #phext hash tag.

- Implemented as a PHP producer/consumer
- Input: a snapshot of posts with #phext tagged
- Output: a day calendar with #interfractals who are discussing #phext!

No, #phext is a bedrock technology for information.

Normal text is 2D - columns and lines.
Phext amps that up to 11D - by adding a coordinate system of coordinate systems.

Z: Libraries, Shelves, Series
Y: Collections, Volumes, Books
X: Chapters, Sections, Scrolls

#phext is a way to expand text to encompass all information on the Internet into one logical file.

You can think of it as a coordinate system of coordinate systems.

To navigate phext, you need 9 more dimension breaks. See https://phext.io/examples.html for a sampling of ideas.

Semantic Zoom would pair well with http://phext.io!

I'm currently focused on adding support in core tools (C#, C++, Rust, js, etc.) - but at some point I'll start hacking on the UX.

the phext box plan:

- reset computing to 1985, but with #phext
- 5 sub-environments (stable, next, manage, update, visor)
- goal: minimize latency above all else
- goal: zero data loss for committed work
- goal: never need to reboot, except for hardware failure

if i were paying myself, i'd be charging $150/hr, or $1200/feature.

I was looking for a phrase like "hey chat" and I've been using a lot of ph words due to #phext, so I coined "pham" because it invokes a sense of belonging.

When I looked up the etymology...I was hooked.
