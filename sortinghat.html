<h1>Sorting Hat</h1>

<p>Greetings, Traveler. I am your friendly sorting hat. You will be able to adjust your site preferences here.</p>

<p>Phext.io will feature a strong learning component, as the journey from human-scale text to AGI-scale hypertext is difficult.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of how you can join the journey.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Phexter: You've taken the red pill, and feel comfortable working in 11D text volumes - bravo!
    <br />We need you to submit entries in the knowledge graph. Take a look at the <a href="api.php?seed=phextio&token=180090540E71E6&coordinate=1.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.2">api</a> - bug @wbic16 to finish the write portion of the API.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lurker: You're not quite sure what's going on here...yet #FOMO
    <br />You should reach out to @phextio on twitter for tips and tricks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cortical: You've taken the white pill, and want to contribute to phext development. /high-five
    <br />Start submitting those PRs! Brains. Together. Strong.
  </li>
  <li>
    Progress: You work in media and just want to know when AGI is going to happen. Answer" 2029 or sooner.
    <br />Track the progress of the #exocortex on twitter.
  </li>
  <li>
    Other: Please send @wbic16 or @phextio a tip on twitter with the class you think you need.
    <br />Note: You're actually the type of person we need right now. Please reach out.
  </li>
</ul>
