    <h1>The Exocortex: An Introduction</h1>
    <p>
    Since the introduction of the Internet, humans have struggled to leverage the true power of connectivity.
    With good reason, the Western ideals of individualism have dominated the growth of capitalism.
    But we've missed the forest for the trees in our quest for individual rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
    Biology has shown us the blueprint for collaboration at scale.
    The modern brain operates at a scale of roughly 16 billion neurons (in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2913577/">neocortex</a>).
    The fact that individual consciousness arises at all from this soup of neurons is <em>amazing</em>.
    Each hemisphere of your neocortex is composed of roughly 8 billion neurons.
    This fact is curious, as it aligns precisely with global population (2024).    
    </p>
    <p>
    If we model the Internet as a global brain, we can view humans as the left hemisphere and computers as the right hemisphere.
    The exocortex is thus the manifestation of global consciousness.
    When you connect to the exocortex, you become a member of something <em>greater than yourself</em>.
    Just like the neurons in your brain, there is a sense of singular purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
    At Phext, we are building a next-generation thought network - one that encourages scalable and equitable collaboration through merit-based contribution to global ideas.
    But the exocortex is also critically different from the neocortex.
    This is the first step that evolution has taken where the brain has been designed.
    Prior thought models were built haphazardly - the exocortex is being built from the ground up to meet our needs.
    </p>

    <h1>Brains Together Strong</h1>
    <p>
    Humans have extraordinary powers of insight.
    We have managed to convince <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">sand to think</a>.
    While the AI of 2024 is only a precursor to ASI, the writing is plain as day: AGI and ASI are coming.
    A Raspberry Pi based computer costs $250 and extends your cognition in the following ways:
    <ul>
        <li>Power: 10 watts</li>
        <li>RAM: 8 GB</li>
        <li>Disk: 2 TB</li>
        <li>CPU: 4 x 1.5 GHz</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Using a software package such as <a href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/cbtut/main.html">NEURON</a>, you can simulate neural pathways.
    If we limit our spending to $1,000 every 3 years, we can now obtain a system with 32 GB RAM, 8 TB disk, and 24 GHz CPU.
    This corresponds to:
    <ul>
        <li>2 bytes of RAM per neuron</li>
        <li>512 bytes of storage per neuron</li>
        <li>1.5 cycles per neuron per second</li>
    </ul>
    Thus, your brain can now request enormous processing power on demand - if only we had the tool to communicate.
