this phext contains a selection of essays that were inspired by the post above. if you'd like your essay added, pm <a href="https://twitter.com/wbic16">@wbic16</a>.

some math
---------
visakanv has 76.6K followers
let's say that 1% of them submit essays
that's 760 essays - let's plan for half that - at 7^3 = 343 essays
so each essay will be given a number 1.1.1 through 7.7.7

reach out to me on twitter to figure out your scroll index - it's a fractal soundex of your username, your topic, and your essay title. you can also use the powershell script embedded in this phext to compute it. or head on over to https://phext.io/essays.html to generate it.

here's an index for examples
