description:

the re-usable phext widget will offer three primary modes:
1. Nested Tabs
2. Zoomable Tiles
3. Subspace

In Nested Tabs mode, users will have a view similar to Terse Notepad.
- A tree view on the left to select nodes with content from.
- A normal text editor on the right.

In Zoomable Tiles mode, users will have a 'phext native' way to interact.
- Callback method to generate tile summary from nearest content by phext coordinate
- no need to jump through multiple levels of hierarchy by hand - quick jump
- easily flow to nearby content

In Subspace mode, users will just work with the raw text buffer.
- Explore custom glyphs for rendering the 9 dimension breaks
- does not need much customization - what you get in most other editors
