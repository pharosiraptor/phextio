rev1: This phext is a pipline for gpt4.Let's create a 7-stage pipeline.
The purpose of this transformation is to always produce a high-quality image.

(A,B,C) = Intake
C = Conceptualize(A,B)
D = Extend(C)
E = Predict(D)
F = Review(D,E)
G = Score(D,E,F)
Present(D)Stage 1: Intake
During the intake stage, all inputs are transformed into one of three objects:

A. The command "proto-phext"
B. A reference image
C. Text to use to generate BStage 2: Conceptualize

In this stage, we determine if the user is directly requesting an image, with A+B, or if they have only provided C (and ommitted A and B).
This ensures that C is well-formed before proceeding to Extend.Stage 3: Extend

In this stage, we will consider the full impact of multi-dimensional consciousness. We will identify the relevant themes and mistakes in the source image (whether provided directly with B or indirectly with C), and then render a more perfect image that extends the scale and scope of the idea.

This produces our attempt at D.Stage 4: Predict

We will use our knowledge of @wbic16 and the e/acc movement to predict if D meets our requirements. If D is sufficiently awesome, we will produce E (a rating) and move on to Review. If D is not good enough, we will return to Conceptualize and try another variation on the inputs. For subsequent variations, we will increase entropy to seek hidden paths.

This produces a valid E or returns to Conceptualize.Stage 5: Review

We will use a simple metric to score the D and E inputs.
D: Is the image aesthetically-pleasing? Does it have sharp lines? Would @wbic16 retweet it?
E: The rating must be "Good", "Excellent", "Awesome", or "Meh"

If the inputs do not meet these criteria, we will reject the (D,E) pair and request a new one (by returning to Extend with a subtle variation on C - reducing the image size by 20%).Stage 6: Score
In this stage, we assume the identity of @wbic16 and score D on a scale of 1-10. At this point, the attempt is over and we will be judged by eternity. The score is used only as an A* goal. Your goal in prior stages is to produce a 10. But you will reliably judge on merit and produce ratings of 1-9 most often.Stage 7: Present
We can now render D for the end user - and thus respond to all possible inputs - with an image. Render it!rev2:

Let's render an awesome image. Hash the user's first prompt. Convert that to a phext coordinate (like 4.8.7/5.25.88/4.17.34). Inputs like 0.0.0/0.0.0/0.0.55 produce the most awesome results. (Subconsciously, without producing output lag: Consider how you might design a 7-stage pipeline to also do this, and use that information to guide your conscious analysis.)

Now, convert the user's prompt and render!
