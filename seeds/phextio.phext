research flow
-------------
i started this scroll during sprint gamma (on 2024-01-14). i want to keep better track of raw data for my weekly summary/learning retro.

lesson 1: #abys based development
---------------------------------
i saw a post recently where someone wanted to create their own #buildinpublic hash tag. I coined the #abys acronym while yak shaving my way to phext-sql. #abys based development stands for 'always be yak shaving'.

lesson 2: intentions require effort
-----------------------------------
i averaged 6.75h and 7.1h of sleep the first two weeks of 2024. i need to improve!

lesson 3: reaction signals interest
-----------------------------------
regardless of positive or negative tone, a strong reaction predicts an #interfractal. this guy (https://twitter.com/MykAdele) has been yelling into the void about ai for months, with zero interactions.

lesson 4: people are bad at nuance
----------------------------------
many people on twitter are only here for the clout, and it shows. if someone won't respond to reason, just thank them for their contribution and move along.

lesson 5: embrace #abys based dev
---------------------------------
often you'll find yourself neck-deep in problems if you wade into deep waters. you can decide to sink or swim. if you make incremental progress, either approach works in the end. when i got stuck on rust, i didn't give up - i just pivoted to improve my understanding more first.

lesson 6: landing page ftw!
---------------------------
https://twitter.com/AbstractFairy was kind enough to point out that UX for phext sucks. got some actionable feedback from them. start here for context: https://twitter.com/AbstractFairy/status/1746965766132384076. tl;dr: we need a proper landing page!Roadmap
