<h1>learn phext!</h1>

<p>here are some example phexts to play with! phext is foundational, so many of the abstractions you know and love are enhanced by the dimensional pockets that phext opens up. phext often leans into these tools, enhancing your existing workflows!</p>

<p>2024-01-11: use case links are being prepared - hit me up on twitter if there's an example you are curious about that isn't up yet</p>

<p>This page is broken down into three main areas:

        <li>concepts</li>
        <li>prototypes</li>
        <li>vaporware</li>

    Concepts are ideas that you need to install in your brain. Prototypes are concepts that you can download and try. Vaporware is a collection of ideas that you should help me implement!</p>

    <td>gzip</td>
    <td>we don't tend to think of text as being a compression format, but it is! most lines, on average, are fewer than 80 or 100 characters. whenever you insert a line break, you are <em>compressing</em> text. phext takes this idea and extends it from 2d to 11d by adding scrolls, sections, chapters, books, volumes, collections, series, shelves, and libraries to the columns and lines of normal text files. phext coordinates allow us to precisely locate any region of text no matter how large the space.

    <td class="alt">text</td>
    <td class="alt">
        <p>phext makes use of an 11-dimensional text space that i affectionately call subspace (as a thank you to star trek for expanding my mind as a child). if phext stopped at subspace, it would work quite well for large language models, but not much else. in order for humans to make sense of subspace, we need a mechanism for walking phext spaces.</p>
        <p>consider for a moment how 2D text is presented on a screen. as you type characters from subspace, they are rendered in positional order. there are no indexes or offsets to consider - everyone agrees that each byte advances your position by 1 position to the right*.</p>
        <p>the humble line break introduced a major design split between the pc industry and mainframes. in the 1970s, computers were very limited in available memory. a computer with 2 KB of memory versus 4 KB of memory might double the cost of your purchase! note that a single page of text is usually 80 columns x 25 characters - about 2 KB.</p>
        <p>it turns out that most lines are empty space, though (see compression above). so unless you're writing war &amp; peace, you can probably get by with 1 KB of memory. this cuts the cost of your early computer by quite a bit!</p>
        <p>ok, so back to today: we have terabytes of disk space and gigabytes of memory - why does this matter?</p>
        <p>because every text file you've ever worked with was just at phext coordinate 1.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.1! let's break down what i mean here. consider what happens if you want to encode multiple pages of text. you might think about adding another parameter: a scroll. as you generate new scrolls, you need a way to unique identify each position within subspace.</p>
        <p>the first scroll of phext is assigned number 1 - like columns and lines before it. but something interesting happens when you jump from scroll 1 to scroll 2: you need to reset your column and line counters back to 1! this gives us the recipe for extending phext from 3 dimensions up to 11.</p>
        <p>repeat the process above while adding more dimensions, and always resetting the lower dimensions to 1 with each new dimension break. what you arrive at is phext: a family of file formats designed for the singularity.</p>
        <p>phext addresses are designed to feel familiar - a bit like an IPv4 address. but they are much more flexible - each scroll is an unbounded text file. each dimension is unlimited as well - although you'll quickly run out of disk space if you abuse the coordinate system too much. for this reason, i usually limit my editors to N=100 per dimension.</p>

                phext continues the long tradition of ASCII and utf8 text. it is a natural evolution, designed from the ground up to remain as compatible as possible with older text files. a selection of bytes that have not been used widely for several decades was used as the basis for phext. my intention is that phext fits into the gap that has apparently been waiting for it. just like the F2-F10 keys on your keyboard (see terse notepad).
            </p>
            <p>
                terse notepad is a phext-compliant editor that i wrote back when phext was called terse. a redditor noted that IBM apparently wrote a terse file format back in the 80s, so i ended up renaming terse to phext as a result. it is a c# application that provides access to phext coordinates, but does not group them into the zzz/yyy/xxx format i use these days. i need to go back and update it for phext conventions.

            <p>phext lends itself very well to relational data structures - it is possible to encode and link information through both encapsulation as well as composition. an area where phext jumps ahead, however, is in the ability to coordinate multiple document types with ease. phext helps you manage complexity by restricting file types to be set on a per scroll basis. this is mostly a pragmatic design choice - allowing phext files to be split out to normal file system trees easily.</p>            
            <p>i started on a fork of <a href="https://github.com/wbic16/notepad-plus-plus">notepad++</a> that provides phext editing. i ran into a learning curve with scintilla and notepad++ internals. generally-speaking, we need to port phext to every text editor on the planet.</p>

            <p>strings are a fundamental concept in every programming language. they have allowed us to build amazing tools, but we stopped short when we decided that tab-delimited files were a bad idea. the missing ingredient was phext. by introducing the concept of exponential growth into our delimiter types, we gain tremendous flexibility in encoding information.</p>
            <p>i've started a c library as the bedrock of phext. this library provides a simple api for extracting text files from a phext archive. note that most phext editors do not need to extract text - this library is just a stepping stone.</p>

            <p>conceptually, we can imagine phext as a file system within a file. since there are no built-in file size limitations, it is quite easy to expand a phext as needed. you simply inject more bytes into the data stream. a phext is closed once a null byte terminator is reached - just like regular text.</p>
            <p>we need to make this idea real by writing a linux file system driver that mounts into a single phext. this would make interacting with phexts simpler, as our existing abstractions for editors and tools would just work.</p>

            <p>phext will streamline data collection by ensuring that you never have to fully parse data in order to start processing it. each scroll is a stand-alone document - imagine the terror of parsing a multi-petabyte json document by comparison!</p>

            <p>this particular use case is aligned with the <a href="/white-rabbit.html">white-rabbit</a> learning module on this site. given a regular expression, we can imagine a tool that allows anyone in the world to comment and expand upon it. we could build a library of every regex ever used - and help people learn why they are so powerful.</p>

            <p>phext gives us a window into fully-formed ideas at scale - we can imagine merging many phexts together to build knowledge that simultaneously makes sense to humans and computers. with phext seeds and docker containers at our disposal, i am confident that we can solve the replication crisis in science.</p>

            <p>naming things is the hardest part of computer science. let's say that you want to fork your class into two parts, because it is now 2,000 lines long. not only do you need to re-factor your files...you also have to pick a new name for the forked-out class.</p>
            <p>but what if ... you could simply organize your code into a hierarchy? if a problem is truly complex, don't fight the complexity: just manage it. phext frees you to focus on the problem, not how your project is structured. we need to add phext support to compilers, linkers, and build systems like cmake in order to realize this vision.</p>
